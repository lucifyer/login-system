Basic Login System

A Basic Login System built on only HTML and php with features like
#Forgot password
#Change password
#Verification of account via email Address

This uses PHPMailer-master repo to send mails.

This is a login system striped to the bare minimum so that you can either understand it from the basic or use it in your project with your style and validations.
